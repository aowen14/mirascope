"""
We automatically convert functions into their proper tool; however, there are often
functions that are not well documents that we would still like to use as tools. In these
cases we can define a model provider specific tool, such as `OpenAITool` or `GeminiTool`
for use with that specific model provider. This example uses `OpenAITool`, but you can
just as easily use `GeminiTool` with no additional change.
